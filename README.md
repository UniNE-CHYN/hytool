# hytool
Hytool is a matlab toolbox for the interpretation of hydraulic tests in wells. The toolbox contains analytical solutions used to describe groundwater flow around wells, and functions for importing, displaying, and fitting a model to the data. 

The [Wiki page](https://github.com/UniNE-CHYN/hytool/wiki)  of this repository explains how to install hytool on your machine.

To learn how to use hytool, a series of detailed examples and manuals are provided within the Matlab help.
