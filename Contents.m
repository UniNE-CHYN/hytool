%
%   Hytool is a matlab toolbox that provides an open environement for the 
%   interpretation of hydraulic tests.    
% 
%   The toolbox contains some of the most usual analytical solutions used 
%   to describe groundwater flow around wells, as well as functions for 
%   importing, displaying the data, and fitting a model to the data.
%
%   One of the main interest of hytool is that it can be extended by the 
%   user to include additional solutions when they are required.
