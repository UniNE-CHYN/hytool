<p>The toolbox development started in 1997 in the
Engineering Geology group of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.
The tool was used for a well testing class given by P. Renard. Since then,
the tool and the class have continued to be developed at the University of Neuchatel.

<p>The development of hytool has then been made possible because of the impulsion,
  help and the contribution of students and colleagues. The first impulsion was
  given by Prof. S. Loew from ETHZ.

<p>The design and the coding of the toolbox has been made essentially by
  <a href='https://www.unine.ch/philippe.renard/home/the-team/philippe-renard.html'>Philippe Renard</a>
  with important direct or indirect contributions from Damian Glenz,
  J&eacute;rome Spring, S&eacute;bastien Deyres, Jaouher Kerrou, and Boris Kaus.

<p>The authors are thankful of the Swiss Tax payers who supported indirectly the project
development through the salary of P. Renard.

<p>Another major source of funding was the Spanish Geological Survey (IGME) and more
precisely the interest of Miguel Mejias-Moreno and Cristina Fernandez-Arozo
in this project.

<p>Tracking the bugs was made essentially by the undergraduate and
postgraduate students of the University of Neuchatel and by IGME.
