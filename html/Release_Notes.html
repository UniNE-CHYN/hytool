<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<hr>


<h2>Version 2.06</h2>  
<p>November 2017
<p>This version is the one corresponding to the paper "Hytool: an open source 
matlab toolbox for the interpretation of hydraulic tests using analytical solutions" 
accepted for publication in the Journal of Open Source Software.
Note that the license has been changed to MIT license. A few minor issues have 
been corrected. In particular some Community guidelines have been added on 
the GitHub page of the project.


<h2>Version 2.05</h2>  
<p>June 2017
<p>This version contains a rather long series of
   minor bug fixes and adaptation to the release 2017
  of matlab. The version has now been transfered to github.

<h2>Version 2.0</h2>
<p>October 2007
<p>This version corresponds to a major update of hytool. This was made
possible thanks to the support of the Spanish Geological Survey (IGME) and
the work of Damien Glenz and S&eacute;bastien Deyres.

<h2>Summary of the changes.</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>A systematic html help is provided, with search tools.
<li><a href="examples.html">Demos</a> have been prepared for most of the models.
<li>The syntax of basic functions has changed in order to be more
systematic.
<ul>
<li>The non linear fit function that were specific to each model
(ths_fit, pcw_fit, csl_fit, etc.) are now replaced by a unique and generic
 <a href="fit.html">fit</a> function.
<li>The functions allowing to plot the results of a test have named
with the rpt suffix instead of tst suffix. Example: <a href="ths_rpt.html">ths_rpt</a>, etc.
<li>The function slug_trial has been removed. The function <a href="trial.html">
trial</a> can now be used both for pumping, slug or pulse tests.
<li>The trial function now uses only the basename of a model. See: <a href="trial.html">
trial</a>
<li>A large number of functions under development has been removed from the
main distribution. These functions are still available in the dev directory,
but they are not systematically documented, and validated and should therefore
be used with caution.
</ul>
<li>The Agarwal time formula has been coded for variable rate tests. See:
<a href="agarwal_time.html">agarwal_time</a>
<li>The report functions have been changed to allow interactive modification
of the graphics.
<li>Most of the routines have been improved and rewritten, in order to be more
robust to errors and to provide a more systematic access to the toolbox
fonctionalities. A large number of new options have been added.
<li>Internal functions to build the help files were developped.
</ul>
